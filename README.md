# Python
This is where I keep my snake.

1. Random Number Generator - No files are needed to run it. Just open it up and see what it does. Used it to learn the sampling feature for taking samples from larger datasets. Cool visualization at the bottom.

2. K-Means Clustering - Who doesn't need a refresher on euclidean distances every now and then? Use the xclara csv file for it.

3. K-Means Scikit-Learn - Once you're refreshed and up to speed, learn to make it even better with fancier techniques.

4. Diagonal Correlation Matrix - A cool half matrix that looks really nice when exploring data relationships.

5. Distplot(x) - Seaborn makes plotting really easy when wanting to know what a variable looks like.

6. Data Exploration Template - Plug and play adventure for using some of the above techniques to explore datasets.

7. Preprocessing Data - What it means to normalize a data variable and how to do that with sklearn.

8. PCA & Logistic Regression - A tutorial on using pipelines to run a Principle Component Analysis and then a Logistic Regression.
