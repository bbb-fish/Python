# Python
This is where I keep my snake.

1. Random Number Generator - No files are needed to run it. Just open it up and see what it does. Used it to learn the sampling feature for taking samples from larger datasets. Cool visualization at the bottom.

2. K-Means Clustering - Who doesn't need a refresher on euclidean distances every now and then? Use the xclara csv file for it.
